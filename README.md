# Bank-app
Bank app created in Java. This was a school project for Lule√• Tekniska Universitet for the course: "Objektorienterad programmering i Java"


A bank application where you can create customers, edit customes and delete customers.
For each customer you can create bank accounts, choose between a savings account and a credit account. Both work differently with interest rate with withdrawing and depositing. 

When selecting an account you can deposit money or withdraw money. You can check out the transactions on that page as well, and if you wish you could save these transactions to a file.

If you want to save the customers and their accounts to a file, to later load them again you can do so on the top left button File - Save. And to load File - Load.

On the help button up top there is a large description on how the program works, but only available in Swedish.
